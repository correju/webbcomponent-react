# webbcomponent-react
## The main idea
This repo is the second proof of concept for micro-frontend, the first concpt was mounted with @polymer/lit-element.

In my professional experience micro-frontends can be applied in two cases:

1. Large teams working in an App with different developments needs and frameworks necesities.
1. There is an app but you need to isolate the new code from the legacy.

I will avoid using framworks like angular or vue due to the size library.

You can read the concepts in:
